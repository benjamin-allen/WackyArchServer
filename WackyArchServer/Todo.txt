[] A way to hide tests so that users can't just brute force an output.
[] Gamma puzzles? Ask for a single line of assembly that does something?
	[] zero a register in 1 line
	[] set a register to 1 in one line
	[] shortcut a jump by using jump-address
	[] stop an infinite loop with jump-address
[] Beta Architecture Components
	[x] Memory View
	[x] Disassembly View
	[x] Input Box
	[] STYLING - WOOOO

vvvvvvvvvvvvvv

[] BUGS
	[] #alpha-arch-container isn't fixed height. If there is too much port data it expands.

[] BETA Challenge Ideas
	[x] Just view disassembly to determine the outputs
	[x] Actually do the disassembly by sticking a 0x4FF at the beginning of the code, so they have to manually disassemble.
	[x] View disassembly and have to do some math or scripting on the side
		[x] CRC-8?
	[] Challenge where they can write to memory
	[] Challenge where memory is write-protected (stack smashing)
		[] The program takes in data from the input pipe and adds it to the stack to reverse the contents of the pipe.
		[] At some point earlier in the program, we've got a return value on the stack that will take us to UNLOCK
		[] They need to overwrite the stack pointer

[] ALPHA Challenge Ideas
	[x] bit rotator, since the old one got removed
	[x] Signal interpreter? 5 input pipes, output the number of the pipe that that's 1 at this time
	[] integrator: sum up the values in the pipe and report pairs of (direction of zero crossing, time) data out.
	[x] BCD comparator: Compare a BCD value to a binary value.
