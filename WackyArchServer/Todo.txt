[] A way to hide tests so that users can't just brute force an output.
[] Gamma puzzles? Ask for a single line of assembly that does something?
	[] zero a register in 1 line
	[] set a register to 1 in one line
	[] shortcut a jump by using jump-address
	[] stop an infinite loop with jump-address
[] Beta Architecture Components
	[x] Memory View
	[x] Disassembly View
	[x] Input Box
	[] STYLING - WOOOO

[] BUGS
	[] #alpha-arch-container isn't fixed height. If there is too much port data it expands.

[] Home page with some Alice shit on it
[] Manual Updates

[] BETA Challenge Ideas
	[] Just view disassembly to determine the outputs
	[] Actually do the disassembly by sticking a 0x4FF at the beginning of the code, so they have to manually disassemble.
	[] View disassembly and have to do some math or scripting on the side
		[] CRC-8?
	[] Challenge where they can write to memory
	[] Challenge where memory is write-protected (stack smashing)

[] ALPHA Challenge Ideas
	[x] bit rotator, since the old one got removed
	[x] Signal interpreter? 5 input pipes, output the number of the pipe that that's 1 at this time
	[] integrator: sum up the values in the pipe and report pairs of (direction of zero crossing, time) data out.
	[] BCD comparator: Compare a BCD value to a binary value.
