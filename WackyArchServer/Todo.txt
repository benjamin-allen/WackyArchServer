[] A way to hide tests so that users can't just brute force an output.
[] Gamma puzzles? Ask for a single line of assembly that does something?
	[] zero a register in 1 line
	[] set a register to 1 in one line
	[] shortcut a jump by using jump-address
	[] stop an infinite loop with jump-address

[] Get the thing into Azure
	[] Step 1: Spin up an Azure DB and point the game to that.
	[] Step 2: Spin up an Application Service and point the game to that.

[] BETA Challenge Ideas
	[] Just view disassembly to determine the outputs
	[] Actually do the disassembly by sticking a 0x4FF at the beginning of the code, so they have to manually disassemble.
	[] View disassembly and have to do some math or scripting on the side
		[] CRC-8?
	[] Challenge where they can write to memory
	[] Challenge where memory is write-protected (stack smashing)

[] ALPHA Challenge Ideas
	[] bit rotator, since the old one got removed
	[] Signal interpreter? 5 input pipes, output the number of the pipe that that's 1 at this time
